## Problem Statement

Our goal is to understand and predict the impact of increasing traffic intensity in Lisbon, considering the potential rise in population. This analysis focuses on 11 key entry and exit points of the city to provide actionable insights for future urban planning and traffic management.


### Steps followed 

1. **Load Data into Microsoft Fabric:** Import the raw data into the Microsoft Fabric platform for processing and analysis.

2. **ETL Process:** Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) the data. This includes extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a suitable format, and loading it into a staging area.

3. **Data Cleansing and Transformation:** Perform data cleansing to remove any inconsistencies, duplicates, or errors, and apply necessary transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

4. **Data Quality Check:** Conduct a thorough quality check to ensure the data is accurate, complete, and reliable. This includes validation and verification steps.

5. **Load Data into the Final Data Warehouse:** Transfer the cleansed and transformed data into the final Data Warehouse for long-term storage and accessibility.

6. **Create a Semantic Model:** Develop a semantic model to define the relationships and business logic within the data, making it easier to query and analyze.

7. **Data Visualization:** Use tools like Power BI to create visualizations that represent the data in a meaningful way, making it easier to interpret and understand.

8. **Generate Insights:** Analyze the data to generate actionable insights. This includes identifying trends, patterns, and potential future impacts on traffic intensity given the projected population growth.

9. **Reporting:** Compile the insights and visualizations into comprehensive reports for stakeholders, providing clear and actionable recommendations.
